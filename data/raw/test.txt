Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts .

I disagree with the statement by Mr. Lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former HUD officials who assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in congressional hearings .	PRP VBP IN DT NN IN NNP NNP IN PRP MD RB VB DT JJ NN IN JJ NNP NNS WP VBP PRP$ NNP NNP NN IN NN IN JJ NNS .
The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself . ''	DT NNP NNP VBZ IN JJ NN IN DT NN `` MD VB VBN , IN DT JJ NN , TO VB DT NN IN PRP . ''
This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify .	DT NN IN NN VBZ DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN WP VBZ RB TO VB .
Thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to `` take the Fifth . ''	RB , IN DT JJ NN , DT NN MD RB VB IN DT NN POS NN TO VB CC MD DT NN VB VBN TO VB DT NN IN DT NN , RB VBG PRP TO `` VB DT NNP . ''
The privilege , however , has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only .	DT NN , RB , VBZ VBN VBN IN NN IN PRP$ JJ NN TO VB DT NN IN JJ NNS RB .
The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause . ''	DT NNP NNP CC DT NNS VBP RB VBN IN `` DT NNP NNP VBZ RB VB DT NN WRB DT NN VBZ VBN IN DT NN TO DT JJ NN . ''
Baxter v. Palmingiano , 425 U.S. 308 -LRB- 1976 -RRB- .	NNP IN NNP , CD NNP CD -LRB- CD -RRB- .
Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter .

He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution .	PRP MD VB DT NNP IN DT JJ NN RB IN PRP VBZ DT JJ NN CC JJ NN IN PRP$ NN MD VB PRP TO JJ NN .
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .	VBG DT NN TO VB DT NNP IN DT JJ NN VBZ RB VBN IN DT JJ NN TO VB TO VB WRB PRP POS NN VBZ PRP IN DT JJ NN , CC IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN MD VB RB VBN IN PRP IN DT JJ JJ NN .
Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify .	JJ DT NN IN JJ NN , DT NN MD VB DT NN TO VB .
Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .

Ignore `` national service '' in the abstract ; consider specific proposals .	VB `` JJ NN '' IN DT JJ : VB JJ NNS .
