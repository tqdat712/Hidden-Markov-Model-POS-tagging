# POS tagging with Hidden Markov Model
Implemented Hidden Markov Model training and used it to predict the joint probability of a sentence with given POS tags. 
Implemented max a posteriori inference to predict the POS tags of a sentence. 
Conducted quantitive experiments on training and validation sets. 
Graphically represented performances of different values of hyperparameter with Matplotlib.
