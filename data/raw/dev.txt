Reasons for the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway were sketchy yesterday .	NNS IN DT NN IN DT NNP NNP VBD JJ NN .
But most structural engineers attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that supported the decks , and the fact that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable , or `` liquefy , '' in a major quake .

The two-story roadway , designed in the mid-1940s and completed in 1957 , was supported by columns that apparently lacked the kind of steel reinforcement used in highways today .	DT JJ NN , VBN IN DT NNS CC VBN IN CD , VBD VBN IN NNS WDT RB VBD DT NN IN NN NN VBN IN NNS NN .
While the pillars did have long metal bars running vertically through them for reinforcement , they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal `` ties '' that run horizontally through the column , said Leo Parker , a structural engineer in Los Angeles .

Caltrans today uses a variation of the design Mr. Parker describes , with spiraling steel rods inside .	NNP NN VBZ DT NN IN DT NN NNP NNP VBZ , IN JJ NN NNS RB .
But in the case of the Nimitz Freeway , the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck , crushing motorists who were lined up in bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic on the lower deck nearly 15 feet below .

But while they want to be on the alert for similar buying opportunities now , they 're afraid of being hammered by another terrifying plunge .	CC IN PRP VBP TO VB IN DT NN IN JJ NN NNS RB , PRP VBP JJ IN VBG VBN IN DT JJ NN .
The solution , at least for some investors , may be a hedging technique that 's well known to players in the stock-options market .	DT NN , IN JJS IN DT NNS , MD VB DT NN NN WDT VBZ RB VBN TO NNS IN DT NNS NN .
Called a `` married put , '' the technique is carried out by purchasing a stock and simultaneously buying a put option on that stock .	VBN DT `` JJ NN , '' DT NN VBZ VBN RP IN VBG DT NN CC RB VBG DT NN NN IN DT NN .
It 's like `` fire insurance , '' says Harrison Roth , the senior options strategist at Cowen & Co .	PRP POS IN `` NN NN , '' VBZ NNP NNP , DT JJ NNS NN IN NNP CC NNP .
Because a put option gives its owner the right , but not the obligation , to sell a fixed number of shares of the stock at a stated price on or before the option 's expiration date , the investor is protected against a sudden drop in the stock 's price .	IN DT NN NN VBZ PRP$ NN DT NN , CC RB DT NN , TO VB DT JJ NN IN NNS IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN CC IN DT NN POS NN NN , DT NN VBZ VBN IN DT JJ NN IN DT NN POS NN .
But most investment advisers do n't recommend using married puts all the time .	CC JJS NN NNS VBP RB VB VBG JJ NNS PDT DT NN .
That 's because the cost of buying put options eats into an investor 's profit when stock prices rise .	DT VBZ IN DT NN IN VBG NN NNS VBZ IN DT NN POS NN WRB NN NNS VBP .

In addition to hedging new stock purchases , the married-put technique can be used to protect stocks that an investor already owns .	IN NN TO VBG JJ NN NNS , DT JJ NN MD VB VBN TO VB NNS IN DT NN RB VBZ .
In either case , the investor faces three possible outcomes :	IN DT NN , DT NN VBZ CD JJ NNS :
-- If the stock goes up in price between now and the put 's expiration date , the put will probably expire worthless .	: IN DT NN VBZ RB IN NN IN RB CC DT NN POS NN NN , DT NN MD RB VB JJ .
The investor will be out the cost of the put , which is called the `` premium , '' and this loss will reduce the stock-market profit .	DT NN MD VB IN DT NN IN DT NN , WDT VBZ VBN DT `` NN , '' CC DT NN MD VB DT NN NN .
-- If the stock stays at the same price between now and the put 's expiration date , the investor 's loss will be limited to the cost of the put , less any amount realized from a closing sale of the put .	: IN DT NN VBZ IN DT JJ NN IN RB CC DT NN POS NN NN , DT NN POS NN MD VB VBN TO DT NN IN DT NN , CC DT NN VBN IN DT NN NN IN DT NN .
The worst-case scenario would be if the put expires worthless .	DT JJ NN MD VB IN DT NN VBZ JJ .
-- If the price of the stock declines , the put will increase in value .	: IN DT NN IN DT NN VBZ , DT NN MD VB IN NN .
Once the stock price is less than the exercise price , or `` strike price , '' of the put , the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar .	IN DT NN NN VBZ JJR IN DT NN NN , CC `` NN NN , '' IN DT NN , DT NN MD VB DT NN IN DT NN NN IN NN .
The put establishes a minimum selling price for the stock during its life .	DT NN VBZ DT NN NN NN IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN .
When a stock falls below the put 's strike price , the investor simply sells the stock at a loss and simultaneously sells the put at a profit .	WRB DT NN VBZ IN DT NN POS NN NN , DT NN RB VBZ DT NN IN DT NN CC RB VBZ DT NN IN DT NN .
Or , the investor can exercise the put , by tendering the stock to his or her broker in return for payment from another investor who has sold a put on the same stock .	CC , DT NN MD VB DT NN , IN VBG DT NN TO PRP$ CC PRP$ NN IN NN IN NN IN DT NN WP VBZ VBN DT NN IN DT JJ NN .
Brokers handle such transactions through the Options Clearing Corp. , which guarantees all option trades .	NNS VBP JJ NNS IN DT NNP NNP NNP , WDT VBZ DT NN NNS .
The accompanying table shows how this strategy would work for three stocks .	DT JJ NN VBZ WRB DT NN MD VB IN CD NNS .
Though not reflected in the table , an investor should know that the cost of the option insurance can be partially offset by any dividends that the stock pays .	IN RB VBN IN DT NN , DT NN MD VB IN DT NN IN DT NN NN MD VB RB VBN IN DT NNS WDT DT NN VBZ .
For example , Tenneco Inc. pays a quarterly dividend of 76 cents , which would be received before the February option expires and , thus , reduce the cost of using the technique by that amount .	IN NN , NNP NNP VBZ DT JJ NN IN CD NNS , WDT MD VB VBN IN DT NNP NN VBZ CC , RB , VB DT NN IN VBG DT NN IN DT NN .
In this case , the investor 's risk would n't exceed 3.6 % of the total investment .	IN DT NN , DT NN POS NN MD RB VB CD NN IN DT JJ NN .
To simplify the calculations , commissions on the option and underlying stock are n't included in the table .	TO VB DT NNS , NNS IN DT NN CC JJ NN VBP RB VBN IN DT NN .
There are more than 650 stocks on which options may be bought and sold , including some over-the-counter stocks .	EX VBP JJR IN CD NNS IN WDT NNS MD VB VBN CC VBN , VBG DT JJ NNS .
But some investors might prefer a simpler strategy then hedging their individual holdings .	CC DT NNS MD VB DT JJR NN RB VBG PRP$ JJ NNS .
They can do this by purchasing `` index puts , '' which are simply put options on indexes that match broad baskets of stocks .	PRP MD VB DT IN VBG `` NN VBZ , '' WDT VBP RB VBN NNS IN NNS WDT VBP JJ NNS IN NNS .
For instance , the most popular index option is the S&P 100 option , commonly called the OEX .	IN NN , DT RBS JJ NN NN VBZ DT NNP CD NN , RB VBN DT NNP .
It is based on the stocks that make up Standard & Poor 's 100-stock index .	PRP VBZ VBN IN DT NNS WDT VBP RP NNP CC NNP POS CD NN .
Unlike options on individual issues , index options are settled only in cash , and no stock is ever tendered .	IN NNS IN JJ NNS , NN NNS VBP VBN RB IN NN , CC DT NN VBZ RB VBN .
But while index options are convenient , they have several disadvantages .	CC IN NN NNS VBP JJ , PRP VBP JJ NNS .
For one thing , an investor 's portfolio might not closely match the S&P 100 .	IN CD NN , DT NN POS NN MD RB RB VB DT NNP CD .
As a result , the OEX insurance may or may not fully protect an investor 's holdings in the event of a market decline .	IN DT NN , DT NNP NN MD CC MD RB RB VB DT NN POS NNS IN DT NN IN DT NN NN .
In addition , OEX options were suspended from trading last Friday afternoon , after the stock-market sell-off got under way and trading in the S&P-500 futures contract was halted .	IN NN , NNP NNS VBD VBN IN VBG JJ NNP NN , IN DT NN NN VBD IN NN CC NN IN DT NNP NNS NN VBD VBN .
So an investor who wanted to realize a profit on OEX puts after the trading suspension would have been out of luck .	IN DT NN WP VBD TO VB DT NN IN NNP NNS IN DT NN NN MD VB VBN IN IN NN .
On the other hand , only a handful of individual issues were suspended from trading on Friday .	IN DT JJ NN , RB DT NN IN JJ NNS VBD VBN IN VBG IN NNP .
Normally , once the underlying investment is suspended from trading , the options on those investments also do n't trade .	RB , RB DT JJ NN VBZ VBN IN VBG , DT NNS IN DT NNS RB VBP RB VB .
Ultimately , whether the insurance provided by purchasing puts is worthwhile depends on the cost of the options .	RB , IN DT NN VBN IN VBG NNS VBZ JJ VBZ IN DT NN IN DT NNS .
That cost rises in times of high market volatility .	DT NN VBZ IN NNS IN JJ NN NN .
But it still might be cheaper than taking a major hit .	CC PRP RB MD VB JJR IN VBG DT JJ NN .
The protection from using married puts is clearly superior to that afforded by another options strategy some investors consider using during troubled times : selling call options on stocks the investor owns .	DT NN IN VBG JJ NNS VBZ RB JJ TO DT VBN IN DT NNS NN DT NNS VBP VBG IN JJ NNS : VBG NN NNS IN NNS DT NN VBZ .
A call option is similar to a put , except that it gives its owner the right to buy shares at a stated price until expiration .	DT NN NN VBZ JJ TO DT NN , IN IN PRP VBZ PRP$ NN DT NN TO VB NNS IN DT JJ NN IN NN .
Selling a call option gives an investor a small buffer against a stock-market decline .	VBG DT NN NN VBZ DT NN DT JJ NN IN DT NN NN .
That 's because it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call .	DT VBZ IN PRP VBZ DT NN IN DT NN IN DT NN IN NN VBN IN DT NN IN DT NN .
But if the price of the stock rises above the strike price of the option , the stock is almost certain to be called away .	CC IN DT NN IN DT NN VBZ IN DT NN NN IN DT NN , DT NN VBZ RB JJ TO VB VBN RP .
And in that case , the investor misses out on any major upside gain .	CC IN DT NN , DT NN VBZ RP IN DT JJ JJ NN .
These calculations exclude the effect of commissions paid and dividends received from the stock .	DT NNS VBP DT NN IN NNS VBN CC NNS VBN IN DT NN .

In this light , the comparative advantages of legislative law-making become clear : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Before it acts , the legislature typically will hear the views of representatives of all those affected by its decision , not just the immediate parties before the court ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the legislature can frame `` bright line '' standards that create less uncertainty than the fact-bound decisions of courts .

The 101-year-old magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much fervor before .	DT JJ NN VBZ RB VBN TO VB NNS IN RB RB JJ NN RB .
It largely rested on its hard-to-fault demographics : 10.8 million subscribers in the first half , up from 10.5 million a year ago ; an average age of 42 for readers -- at the height of their consuming years ; loyalty to the tune of an 85 % average subscription renewal rate .

But this year , when the hullabaloo surrounding its centennial died , so too did some advertiser interest .	CC DT NN , WRB DT NN VBG PRP$ NN VBD , RB RB VBD DT NN NN .
The reason , ad executives say , is that the entire magazine business has been soft -- and National Geographic has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market .	DT NN , NN NNS VBP , VBZ IN DT JJ NN NN VBZ VBN JJ : CC NNP NNP VBZ DT NNS WDT VBP PRP RB JJ IN DT JJ NN .
Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices -- $ 130,000 for a four-color page , vs. $ 47,000 for the Smithsonian , a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation .	RB DT JJS IN DT NNS VBZ PRP$ JJ NN NNS : $ CD IN DT JJ NN , FW $ CD IN DT NNP , DT JJ NN IN DT RB JJR NN .
When ad dollars are tight , the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers , who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all .	WRB NN NNS VBP JJ , DT JJ NN NN VBZ DT JJ NN IN NNS , WP RB VBP TO VB RB IN DT NN CC RB IN DT .
Even though National Geographic offers far more readers than does a magazine like Smithsonian , `` the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency , '' says Harry Glass , New York media manager for Bozell Inc .

To combat that problem , National Geographic , like other magazines , began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines -- for example , ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest 25 markets .

Time magazine , for example , has more than 100 separate editions going to different regions , top management , and other groups .	NNP NN , IN NN , VBZ JJR IN CD JJ NNS VBG TO JJ NNS , JJ NN , CC JJ NNS .
Another sticking point for advertisers was National Geographic 's tradition of lumping its ads together , usually at the beginning or end of the magazine , rather than spreading ads out among its articles , as most magazines do .

But Ms. McCraw says the magazine is fighting back .	CC NNP NNP VBZ DT NN VBZ VBG RB .

If they were to insist on a low bid of , say $ 200 a share , the board might n't be able to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction the pilots oppose .
